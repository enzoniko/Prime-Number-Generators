### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis and Recommendations

#### Introduction and Context
The report focuses on implementing and analyzing algorithms for generating large random numbers and testing their primality, specifically for cryptographic applications in resource-constrained systems such as embedded devices and IoT applications. These systems prioritize computational performance and energy efficiency due to their limited hardware capabilities, such as low memory, processing power, and battery life. The algorithms identified are Linear Congruential Generator (LCG), Xoshiro256++, Miller-Rabin, and Baillie-PSW. The objective is to enhance the report by adding scientific references and providing robust justifications for their selection, aligning with the goals of higher computational performance and energy efficiency.

#### Detailed Justifications for Algorithm Selection

##### A. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)
PRNGs are essential for simulations, cryptography, and other applications requiring random sequences, particularly in systems where true randomness is impractical. The choice of LCG and Xoshiro256++ is justified by their performance characteristics in resource-constrained settings.

- **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG):**
  - **Rationale**: LCGs are among the simplest and fastest PRNGs, requiring only a few arithmetic operations (multiplication, addition, and modulo) per random number. They are memory-efficient, typically storing one state variable (often 32 or 64 bits), which is critical for systems with limited RAM.
  - **Performance in Resource-Constrained Systems**: LCGs are widely used in embedded systems and video game consoles due to their speed and minimal resource requirements. For instance, they are easy to implement in hardware, as evidenced by studies on VLSI architectures focusing on power, delay, and area efficiency. Their simplicity reduces energy consumption, as fewer operations mean less power draw, which is vital for battery-powered devices.
  - **Limitations**: LCGs have shorter periods and potential issues with low-order bits when the modulus is a power of 2, but these can be mitigated by using higher-order bits, which is feasible in constrained systems where simplicity is prioritized over statistical quality.
  - **Supporting Evidence**: The paper "Hardware Implementation of the Baillie-PSW Primality Test" ([IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8053007)) discusses the use of PRNGs, including LCGs, in hardware for cryptographic contexts, emphasizing their suitability for embedded systems. Additionally, "A Guideline on Pseudorandom Number Generation (PRNG) in the IoT" ([DeepAI](https://deepai.org/publication/a-guideline-on-pseudorandom-number-generation-prng-in-the-iot)) evaluates LCGs for their performance in IoT systems, highlighting their efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

- **Xoshiro256++:**
  - **Rationale**: Xoshiro256++ is a modern PRNG designed for high performance and good statistical properties. It has a small state size (256 bits) and is optimized for speed, making it suitable for systems with limited memory and processing capabilities. It is particularly effective on architectures like ARM Cortex-A53, commonly found in embedded and IoT devices.
  - **Performance in Resource-Constrained Systems**: Benchmarks, such as those discussed in "Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators" ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460772)), show Xoshiro256++ achieving high throughput (e.g., 2560 MB/s on ARM Cortex-A53 with GCC), indicating computational efficiency. Its simplicity and low memory usage imply energy efficiency, as it requires fewer operations and less memory access, reducing power consumption. This is crucial for energy-sensitive applications like IoT sensors. The official xoshiro/xoroshiro generators page ([prng.di.unimi.it](https://prng.di.unimi.it/)) notes its use in IoT operating systems like Mbed and Zephyr, further supporting its applicability in constrained environments.
  - **Supporting Evidence**: The paper "Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators" discusses the Xoshiro family, including Xoshiro256++, and their efficiency in various computational contexts, including embedded systems. The xoshiro/xoroshiro page also provides performance metrics and contexts for such evaluations, noting its intended usage in embedded hardware.

##### B. Primality Testing Algorithms
Primality testing is critical for cryptographic applications, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, where large prime numbers are needed. In resource-constrained systems, the choice of algorithm must balance speed, reliability, and resource usage.

- **Miller-Rabin:**
  - **Rationale**: Miller-Rabin is a probabilistic primality test known for its speed and efficiency. It can be tuned by adjusting the number of rounds, allowing flexibility based on the desired level of certainty. This makes it suitable for embedded systems where quick checks are necessary, and computational resources are limited.
  - **Performance in Resource-Constrained Systems**: The test is computationally lightweight, requiring only a few modular exponentiations per round, which can be optimized for hardware like FPGAs or microcontrollers. It is widely used in practice for its efficiency, as noted in "Hardware Implementation of the Baillie-PSW Primality Test" ([IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8053007)), which reviews hardware implementations of Miller-Rabin. For embedded systems, reducing the number of rounds can further enhance energy efficiency, as fewer operations reduce power draw.
  - **Supporting Evidence**: The paper "Taxonomy and Practical Evaluation of Primality Testing Algorithms" ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342198735_Taxonomy_and_Practical_Evaluation_of_Primality_Testing_Algorithms)) provides a comprehensive overview, discussing Miller-Rabin's practical applications in cryptography, including its efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

- **Baillie-PSW:**
  - **Rationale**: Baillie-PSW combines Miller-Rabin with the Lucas-Selfridge test, offering very high reliability with no known pseudoprimes, making it ideal for applications requiring certainty, such as cryptographic key generation. While slightly more computationally intensive than Miller-Rabin alone, it remains efficient enough for many resource-constrained applications.
  - **Performance in Resource-Constrained Systems**: Baillie-PSW is still relatively fast compared to deterministic tests like AKS, and its hardware implementations, such as on FPGAs, demonstrate feasibility in constrained environments. For example, "Hardware Implementation of the Baillie-PSW Primality Test" ([IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8053007)) presents the first hardware implementation on an Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA, analyzing its performance and suggesting methods for improvement. This indicates its suitability for embedded systems where high confidence in primality is needed.
  - **Supporting Evidence**: The same paper provides detailed insights into its hardware implementation, and "Taxonomy and Practical Evaluation of Primality Testing Algorithms" ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342198735_Taxonomy_and_Practical_Evaluation_of_Primality_Testing_Algorithms)) notes its efficiency, with no composite numbers under 264 passing it, reinforcing its reliability in practice.
